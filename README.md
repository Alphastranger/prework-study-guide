# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation with this project was to create an ergonomic resource to study and access my notes. I built this project because it was a great way to learn as I created the resource that I desired. It solves the problem of having my crucial notes scattered in a bunch of different places, and I learned how to do basic HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as I set everything up.
